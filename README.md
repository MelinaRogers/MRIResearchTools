# MRI Research Tools

A Python package for processing and analyzing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, with a focus on Magnitude and Phase images in NIfTI file format.

## Project Status

**Note:** This project is currently under development. The features listed below are in various stages of implementation, and the package is not yet ready for production use. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we continue to build and improve this tool.

## Features (In Progress)

- **Support for 4D NIfTI images**: Processing of echoes in the 4th dimension.
- **Support for 5D NIfTI images**: Handling of channels in the 5th dimension.
- **Advanced phase unwrapping algorithms**: Including ROMEO.
- **Multi-echo coil combination**: Implementation of MCPC-3D-S.
- **Laplacian unwrapping**.
- **Magnitude homogeneity correction**.
- **Robust masking techniques**.
- **Gaussian smoothing**: For real, complex, and phase data.
- **T2* and R2* estimation**.
